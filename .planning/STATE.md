# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-15)

**Core value:** Racers can enter events online and manage their own car/transponder details, while officials run a full race meeting from any Windows or Linux machine — with live timing fed directly from AMB/MyLaps hardware via a local forwarder agent to a cloud-hosted service.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — race-state-machine

## Current Position

Phase: 04

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 7 phases derived from 91 v1 requirements at standard granularity
- Architecture: Modular monolith — single Spring Boot JAR, single PostgreSQL database
- AMB Protocol: Highest-risk unknown — must register at mylaps.com/developers or capture Wireshark traces before Phase 5
- [Phase 04]: LapTimingService uses EntryRepository for transponder resolution via Entry.transponderNumberSnapshot snapshot field
- [Phase 04]: CTRL-09 skip-to is process-local ConcurrentHashMap on RaceControlController — cross-session persistence deferred

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5 blocker]: AMB P3 exact binary frame format for club's decoder model is unknown — need SDK registration or Wireshark capture before forwarder implementation
- [Phase 5 blocker]: Decoder timestamp format (UTC vs session-relative offset) unknown — determines clock drift handling
- [Phase 7 concern]: Championship DNS/DQ scoring policy (does DNS count toward Y rounds?) needs club confirmation before Phase 7 scoring implementation
