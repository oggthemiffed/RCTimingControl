# Installing on a venue laptop

RC Timing Control installs as one package on the laptop that sits by the decoder. The package carries its own Java runtime, so the laptop needs no Java and no Docker. The app runs as a background service with no window and starts when the laptop boots. Officials' phones and tablets and the spectator boards open it in a browser over the venue network.

## What you need

- A laptop running Windows 10 or 11 (64-bit), macOS 12 or later, or a Debian-based Linux such as Ubuntu.
- The installer for that system:

| System | File |
|--------|------|
| Windows | `RCTimingControl-<version>.msi` |
| macOS | `RCTimingControl-<version>.pkg` |
| Linux | `rctimingcontrol_<version>_amd64.deb` |

To build an installer yourself, see [Building the installers](#building-the-installers).

## Install

**Windows.** Double-click the `.msi` file and follow the prompts. Windows may say it protected your PC, because the installer is not signed yet. Choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**. The installer also adds a Windows Firewall rule so other devices can connect on private networks. When the laptop joins the venue network, set that network to **Private** (**Settings → Network & internet → Wi-Fi** or **Ethernet → the network → Private network**). Windows treats new networks as public, and blocks phones from reaching the app on a public network.

**macOS.** The package is not signed yet, so double-clicking it shows a warning. Right-click the `.pkg` file, choose **Open**, then **Open** again. Or open **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and choose **Open Anyway**.

**Linux.** Run:

```bash
sudo apt install ./rctimingcontrol_<version>_amd64.deb
```

The service starts as soon as the install finishes.

## First run

1. On the laptop, open **http://localhost:8080** in a browser. The setup wizard asks for the first official's account, then the club, track and decoder details.
2. Open **http://localhost:8080/about** to see the addresses other devices should use, for example `http://192.168.1.50:8080/`. The same addresses are written to the log each time the app starts.
3. On a phone connected to the same Wi-Fi or network, open one of those addresses and sign in.

The address by the laptop's name, such as `http://timing-laptop:8080/`, works on most phones and keeps working if the laptop gets a different IP address. If it does not work on a phone, use the IP address instead.

If a phone cannot connect, check that it is on the same network as the laptop and not on mobile data. Then check the laptop's firewall. On Windows, check the venue network is set to Private. On macOS with the firewall turned on, allow incoming connections for RC Timing Control in **System Settings → Network → Firewall → Options**. On Linux with `ufw` enabled, run `sudo ufw allow 8080/tcp`.

## Where things are kept

The data lives outside the install folder, so installing a newer version keeps it.

| System | Data folder |
|--------|-------------|
| Windows | `C:\ProgramData\RCTimingControl` |
| macOS | `/Library/Application Support/RCTimingControl` |
| Linux | `/var/lib/rctimingcontrol` |

On Linux the service runs as its own unprivileged user, `rctiming`, so use `sudo` to look in the folder. The folder holds:

- `rctiming.db`, the database;
- `backups/`, the automatic backups;
- `uploads/`, the club logo and announcer clips;
- `logs/rctiming.log`, the app's log;
- `jwt-secret`, the key that signs officials' sign-ins, created on first start. Keep it private.

## Changing settings

To change a setting such as the port, create a file called `application.properties` in the data folder, then restart the service. For example:

```properties
# Use port 80, so devices can open http://timing-laptop/ with no port number
server.port=80
# Keep backups on a USB stick
rctiming.backup.directory=E:/rctiming-backups
```

On Linux the backup folder must be one the `rctiming` user can write to. For a folder on the laptop's own disk, create it with `sudo install -d -o rctiming -g rctiming /srv/rctiming-backups`. A USB stick or network share has to be mounted so that user can write to it, for example with `uid=rctiming,gid=rctiming` in its mount options. The desktop's automatic mount under `/media/<your name>` is private to you, so the service can't use it.

## Sending results to RaceHub

For events whose entries were imported from RaceHub, the app sends the results back as each race finishes, when a finished race is corrected, and when the event is completed, which closes the race day (see [results-export-v1.md](results-export-v1.md)). Give it RaceHub's address and the club's key in `application.properties`:

```properties
rctiming.racehub.results-url=https://racehub.example/api/results
rctiming.racehub.token=the-key-from-racehub
```

The address must start with `https://`, since the key goes with every request. Without both settings the results wait in the app, and are sent once they are set and the service restarted. The laptop doesn't need to be online while racing: results queue while the network is down and go when it is back. **Results to RaceHub** in the admin panel shows what has been sent, and each event's page has a **Download results** button for taking the file across by hand.

## Sending a live feed

The app can send each race as it runs to a relay on the internet, so people away from the track can follow it (see [live-feed-v1.md](live-feed-v1.md)). The laptop connects out to the relay; nothing connects in to it. Give it the relay's address and the club's key in `application.properties`:

```properties
rctiming.livefeed.relay-url=wss://relay.example/publish
rctiming.livefeed.token=the-key-from-the-relay
```

The address must start with `wss://`, since the key goes with the connection. Restart the service after setting them. Race control then shows the live feed's state in its status bar, with a **Send this event** switch that the race director turns on for each event to be sent. If the network or the relay drops out, racing carries on and the feed picks up again when it is back.

## Starting and stopping the service

| System | Stop | Start |
|--------|------|-------|
| Windows | `sc stop RCTimingControl` (or the Services app) | `sc start RCTimingControl` |
| macOS | `sudo launchctl bootout system/dev.monkeypatch.rctiming-RCTimingControl` | `sudo launchctl bootstrap system /Library/LaunchDaemons/dev.monkeypatch.rctiming-RCTimingControl.plist` |
| Linux | `sudo systemctl stop rctimingcontrol-RCTimingControl` | `sudo systemctl start rctimingcontrol-RCTimingControl` |

Run Windows commands from an administrator Command Prompt.

## Restoring a backup

Stop the service, then run the restore command as an administrator (Windows) or with `sudo` (macOS, Linux):

| System | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Windows | `"C:\Program Files\RCTimingControl\RCTimingControl.exe" restore "C:\ProgramData\RCTimingControl\backups\<file>"` |
| macOS | `sudo /Applications/RCTimingControl.app/Contents/MacOS/RCTimingControl restore "/Library/Application Support/RCTimingControl/backups/<file>"` |
| Linux | `sudo /opt/rctimingcontrol/bin/RCTimingControl restore /var/lib/rctimingcontrol/backups/<file>` |

Then start the service again. The restored database is given the data folder's owner, so on Linux the service can still write to it after a restore run with `sudo`.

## Locked out

If no admin can sign in (the only admin forgot their password, or was disabled), reset an admin's password from the laptop itself. Stop the service, then run the command as an administrator (Windows) or with `sudo` (macOS, Linux), giving the admin's email:

| System | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Windows | `"C:\Program Files\RCTimingControl\RCTimingControl.exe" reset-admin-password admin@club.example` |
| macOS | `sudo /Applications/RCTimingControl.app/Contents/MacOS/RCTimingControl reset-admin-password admin@club.example` |
| Linux | `sudo /opt/rctimingcontrol/bin/RCTimingControl reset-admin-password admin@club.example` |

It asks for the new password twice (at least 8 characters). Run it with no email to list the admins. The command also enables the account if it was disabled, gives it the Admin role if it had lost it, and signs it out everywhere. The change shows in **Admin → Officials** under recent changes, as made from the command line. Then start the service again.

Anyone who can run commands as an administrator on the laptop can do this, so keep the laptop's own login safe.

## Upgrading

Install the newer package over the old one, the same way as the first install. The service stops, the new version is put in place, and the service starts again. The new version updates the database to its format when it starts.

## Uninstalling

Uninstall it the usual way for the system: **Settings → Apps** on Windows, or `sudo apt remove rctimingcontrol` on Linux. On macOS, run `sudo launchctl bootout system/dev.monkeypatch.rctiming-RCTimingControl`, then delete `/Library/LaunchDaemons/dev.monkeypatch.rctiming-RCTimingControl.plist` and `/Applications/RCTimingControl.app`. Uninstalling leaves the data folder in place. Delete it as well to remove everything.

## Building the installers

Each installer is built on the system it is for. You need JDK 21 and Node 22.12 or newer, and:

- **Windows:** the WiX Toolset 3, and the 64-bit `nssm.exe` from [NSSM 2.24](https://nssm.cc/download), which registers the service.
- **macOS:** the Xcode command line tools.
- **Linux:** `fakeroot` (`sudo apt install fakeroot`).

Then run:

```bash
./gradlew -PbundleFrontend :app:installer
# Windows also needs the path to nssm.exe:
#   gradlew -PbundleFrontend -PwindowsServiceInstaller=C:\tools\nssm\win64\nssm.exe :app:installer
```

The installer is written to `app/build/installer/out/`. The installer's version is the numeric part of `VERSION` (`0.1.0-alpha.1` builds `0.1.0`); pass `-PinstallerVersion=0.1.1` to set it. macOS does not accept versions starting with 0, so pre-1.0 macOS packages show a leading 1 (`0.1.0` shows as `1.1.0`). The About page always shows the real version.

`-PbundleFrontend` on its own builds a jar with the UI inside: `./gradlew -PbundleFrontend :app:bootJar`, then `java -jar app/build/libs/app.jar` serves everything on port 8080.
