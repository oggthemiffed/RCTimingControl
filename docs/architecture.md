# Architecture

> This document covers the application (`app/`, `frontend/`, `decoder-protocol/`, `decoder-simulator/`). RCTC is the timing side of the RaceHub suite and runs only at the venue (local-only plan, #8). The forwarder, the gRPC link, the racer portal and a separate offline race-day app were removed along the way; the race-day app's plans are archived under `docs/plans/archive/`.

## Overview

Modular monolith — one Spring Boot process, single SQLite database file, installed as a background service on the laptop at the track. The complexity of a distributed system isn't warranted for single-club RC venue scale. The same process serves the built React app, the REST API and the WebSocket, so every device on the venue network (race control, check-in, the announcer, the spectator boards, officials' phones) is just a browser.

## Key design decisions

### CQRS-lite split

Both sides use jOOQ, with no ORM (#69). The domain module owns all writes: plain entities, each saved and loaded by a repository built on `persistence/JooqRepository`. A separate query module (`query/`) builds the read-side projections in SQL: scoring calculations, standings, results, boards. Nothing is lazy-loaded or saved implicitly; a changed entity reaches the database only through its repository's `save`. This boundary is enforced by package structure, not a framework.

### Entries come from RaceHub

RaceHub owns booking, racer accounts and payment. The boundary between the two is one file: RaceHub's **Entry Export v1** JSON, which carries what timing needs and no contact, date of birth, guardian or payment data. An admin imports it into an event (`domain/racehub`):

- Each entry is matched by its RaceHub `entry_id` and applied only when its `entry_version` is higher than the one already imported, so importing the same file twice is safe.
- A withdrawn entry is marked `WITHDRAWN`, never deleted, and keeps its race history.
- RaceHub classes map to the event's classes by `rc_class_name`, with a per-event override.
- A dry run previews the changes; an import with unmapped classes or invalid rows saves nothing.

Officials add walk-ins by hand in the admin entry list. A file works with no internet at the track, and the same format could become a pull from RaceHub later.

### Results go back to RaceHub

For an event imported from RaceHub, the app queues a **Results Export v1** document (`resultsexport/`) when a race finishes, when a finished race is corrected and when the race day is closed (an official completes the event). Each one is the whole event with the next revision number, and replaces any older one that hasn't gone yet. A scheduled sender posts them to RaceHub with the club's key and an idempotency key, and retries with a growing wait while RaceHub can't be reached. The request is a mark on the event, saved in race control's own transaction so it survives a crash; a background job builds the export from it, and a slow or missing network never holds a race up. See [results-export-v1.md](results-export-v1.md).

### Live feed to remote viewers

For an event with the feed turned on, `livefeed/LiveFeedPublisher` sends each race on the grid or running to a relay as **Live Feed v1** messages: the running order with display names only, laps, last and best lap, gaps and the race clock. It runs on a thread of its own, opens one outbound WebSocket with the club's key, reads the in-memory live timing and never writes anything, so a slow or missing relay can't hold timing up. A dropped connection is retried with a growing wait, and every race is sent in full when it comes back. See [live-feed-v1.md](live-feed-v1.md).

### Competitors and transponders

A **competitor** is the person an entry belongs to: a display name, the RaceHub driver ID it came from, a BRCA number and a home club. Competitors have no login. Results, live timing and championship standings group by competitor, so one person's history carries across meetings.

Transponders belong to an **entry**, for one event: a primary and an optional secondary number. They are not unique system-wide, and a number already used in the event is accepted with a warning on import or walk-in, since one competitor may run it in several classes. RaceHub snapshots them at booking; the check-in desk can swap them on the day, with an audit trail, and refuses a number another competitor in the event holds. When a lap arrives, `LapTimingService` matches the number against both transponders of the entries in the running race. A number that matches nothing, or more than one entry, goes to the referee's unknown-transponder flow and is never silently credited.

### JWT authentication

Stateless — no server-side session. Access tokens (15-min TTL) are returned in the response body. Refresh tokens (7-day TTL) are stored in an HttpOnly cookie scoped to `/api/v1/auth/refresh` only, preventing JavaScript access. Token rotation on every refresh. Only officials (`ADMIN`, `RACE_DIRECTOR`, `REFEREE`) can sign in or refresh; anyone else gets 403.

### Race format config (JSON)

Format configurations are stored as JSON text (checked with `json_valid`) and converted by `RaceFormatConfigConverter`, a `JsonTextConverter` the format repositories use. The Java type is a sealed interface (`RaceFormatConfig`) with three record subtypes (`TimedRaceConfig`, `BumpUpConfig`, `PointsFinalsConfig`). Jackson's `@JsonTypeInfo` on the interface provides polymorphic serde. A `type` discriminator column on the table enables SQL-side filtering without deserializing the blob.

Override patches (FORMAT-07) are stored in a second `configOverride` JSON column and merged at read time — base config from the template snapshot, patches applied on top. Template edits do not affect existing event classes (snapshot-at-assignment, FORMAT-06).

### Race state machine

`PENDING → GRID → RUNNING → STOPPED → RUNNING` (resume) or `RUNNING → FINISHED`. Invalid transitions return HTTP 409. Live race positions are **never persisted during a race** — calculated in memory, broadcast over STOMP, persisted only as a final result snapshot on `FINISHED`.

### TCP decoder

The AMB/MyLaps decoder client runs on a dedicated background thread (Netty 4.1, `SmartLifecycle`), completely isolated from the Tomcat thread pool. Parsed `LapPassingEvent`s are posted via `ApplicationEventPublisher` (async listener) to avoid blocking the decoder thread. The listener (`DecoderListener`) reads the decoder's host and port from the club profile, reconnects on its own, and publishes its state to `/topic/system/decoder-status`. Protocol parsing itself (`Rc4TextParser`, `EpochAnchor`, `SeqGapDetector`) lives in the shared `decoder-protocol/` module, used by the listener and `decoder-simulator/`. RC-4 text is implemented; the AMB P3 binary protocol is deferred.

## STOMP topics

| Topic | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `/topic/race/{raceId}/timing` | Live lap passings, positions, gaps |
| `/topic/race/{raceId}/state` | Race lifecycle changes |
| `/topic/race/{raceId}/marshal` | Marshal lap adjustments |
| `/topic/race/{raceId}/unknown-transponder` | A transponder that matched no entry, for the referee |
| `/topic/race/{raceId}/audio` | Announcements for the announcer's browser |
| `/topic/race/{raceId}/bump-up-alert` | Bump-up prompts when a race finishes |
| `/topic/practice/{sessionId}/timing`, `/unknown-transponder` | Open practice |
| `/topic/system/decoder-status` | Whether the decoder is connected |
| `/topic/system/live-feed-status` | Whether the live feed is connected to its relay |

## Roles

Only officials have accounts. Their roles are stackable — one account can hold any combination:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| `ADMIN` | Club config, user management, event setup |
| `RACE_DIRECTOR` | Race control client — start/stop, grid calls, marshal laps |
| `REFEREE` | Penalties, transponder linking, incident reports |
| Competitors | No account: entries come from the RaceHub import or are added as walk-ins |
| Anonymous | Event schedule, live timing, results, standings |

### Data, backups and packaging

The SQLite file lives in a per-machine data folder outside the install folder, so upgrades keep it. The vendor is chosen in one place (`persistence/DatabaseConfig`), Java code uses only the jOOQ DSL and shared converters, and `PersistencePortabilityTest` fails the build on vendor-specific code, so the database could be swapped later (see [development.md](development.md)). Backups are taken when a race day closes, every night and on demand, while racing carries on; `restore` puts one back. The installers (`jpackage`, with their own Java runtime) install the app as a Windows service, a launchd daemon or a systemd unit; see [installing.md](installing.md).
