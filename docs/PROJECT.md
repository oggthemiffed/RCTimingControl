# RCTimingControl

## What This Is

RC club race timing and race control, built to replace RCResults. RCTC is the timing side of the RaceHub suite. RaceHub is a separate cloud app that owns booking, racer accounts and event entry. RCTC runs only at the venue (the local-only timing plan, tracking issue #8).

It is one program on a laptop at the track. It installs as a background service, reads the AMB/MyLaps decoder directly over TCP, and serves race control, check-in, the announcer and the spectator boards to browsers on the venue network. It keeps the club's results and championships. Only officials sign in. Entries arrive in a RaceHub export file or are added as walk-ins.

## Core Value

Officials run a full race meeting from a laptop at the track, on Windows, macOS or Linux, with live timing fed directly from AMB/MyLaps hardware and no dependence on the internet. Entries come in from RaceHub in one file, and the club's results and championships stay on the laptop, backed up.

## Requirements

### Validated

- [x] Admins can create and configure events with multiple races and classes — Phase 3
- [x] Admins can set up championships with configurable "best X from Y rounds" scoring — Phases 3 and 7
- [x] Race control runs in the browser at the track: start and stop races, marshal laps, call the grid, print results — Phase 4
- [x] Live lap timing read from the AMB/MyLaps decoder over TCP (RC-4 text), shown live in the browser — Phases 5 and 6, then read directly by the app (#9)
- [x] Race results published after each race, with individual lap times — Phase 7
- [x] Championship standings and the event schedule visible without login — Phase 7
- [x] Entries imported from RaceHub's Entry Export v1, with class mapping — #15, #16
- [x] Walk-in entries added by hand — #17
- [x] Competitors with no login; results, live timing and standings group by competitor — #12, #13
- [x] A primary and an optional secondary transponder per entry; a number already used in the event is warned about, not refused — #14
- [x] Only officials sign in — #18
- [x] Check-in desk with barcode input and on-the-day transponder swaps; spectator boards — #19, #20
- [x] A full meeting runs with no internet connection at the venue — #8, #21
- [x] One SQLite file, behind a seam that lets the database be swapped later — #26
- [x] Scheduled backups and a restore command — #22
- [x] One installer per system that runs the app as a background service — #23, #24
- [x] Results Export v1 sent back to RaceHub through an outbound queue — #27

### Active

- [ ] Live feed relay so remote viewers can follow timing (#28)
- [ ] Streaming overlay page for OBS (#29)
- [ ] Entry import from other systems: RC-Timing CSV and pull from a URL (#38)
- [ ] AMB P3 binary protocol for decoders on firmware 4.5 or later (deferred)

### Out of Scope

- Racer self-service portal, racer accounts and online entry — **removed** in #18: RaceHub owns racer identity, garage and entry.
- Forwarder process and gRPC link to a cloud service — **removed** in #10: the app reads the decoder directly.
- Separate offline race-day app with cloud sync — **removed** in #21: race day runs locally in RCTC itself.
- Internet deployment (Docker stacks, nginx, TLS) — **removed** in #24: the app stays on the venue network.
- Native mobile app — the web UI works on phones.
- Payment processing — handled by RaceHub, or at the track.

## Context

- **Replacing:** RCResults (rc-timing.com / rc-results.com), a Windows-only client.
- **Suite:** RaceHub handles booking in the cloud. The boundary is RaceHub's Entry Export v1 file, which carries no contact, date of birth, guardian or payment data. Results go back in a Results Export v1 file, keyed by the same RaceHub ids (#27).
- **Timing hardware:** AMB/MyLaps transponder decoders over TCP. RC-4 text (firmware below 4.5, port 5100) is what club hardware uses.
- **Club workflow:** Events have multiple races across classes. Championship series span multiple events, scored by configurable best-X-from-Y rounds (for example, best 4 of 6).
- **Users:** officials only (admins, race directors, referees), with stackable roles. Competitors and spectators use the boards and public pages without signing in.
- **Deployment:** a native installer on the venue laptop, with its own Java runtime, running as a background service. Every client is a browser on the venue network.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack:** Java backend (club expertise; rewriting was considered and rejected in #8), React frontend in the browser.
- **Compatibility:** AMB/MyLaps TCP protocol.
- **Cross-platform:** the laptop can run Windows, macOS or Linux.
- **No internet dependency:** nothing on race day may need the internet.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Browser-based race control | Works on any laptop, and on officials' phones and tablets, with no client install | Shipped |
| AMB/MyLaps TCP integration | Club hardware; the RC-4 text protocol is read directly by the app | Shipped (RC-4); P3 deferred |
| "Best X from Y" championship scoring | Club's primary format; configurable so other clubs can adapt | Shipped |
| Split into a cloud app and a separate offline race-day app | Kept race day running through venue outages | Shipped, then retired in #21. Plan archived at `docs/plans/archive/2026-08-06-001-feat-offline-race-day-resilience-split-plan.md` |
| RCTC is local-only timing; RaceHub owns booking (2026-10-03) | Race day never depends on the cloud, removing the duplicated offline app, the forwarder and the racer portal | Done for #9 to #26; see #8 |
| SQLite, kept swappable (2026-10-03) | One file in the app process, no database server to run at the venue | Shipped in #26 |
| Two transponders per entry (2026-10-04) | Matches RaceHub's export; more per entry may come later | Shipped in #14 |

## Evolution

Keep this document accurate as the project changes.

**When completing a significant feature or fix:**
1. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with a short note
2. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions table
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**Periodically (e.g. after a batch of issues closed):**
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context to reflect current state
