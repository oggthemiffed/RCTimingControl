# Development Guide

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| Java | 21 (LTS) |
| Docker | 24+ (optional: only for Piper announcer voices) |
| Node.js | 20+ |
| Gradle | via wrapper (`./gradlew`) |

## Quick start (Makefile)

A `Makefile` at the repo root wraps all common tasks. Run `make` (or `make help`) to see the full list.

No database server to install: the backend keeps its data in a SQLite file under `app/data/db`, created and migrated on first start.

```bash
make dev-start   # Backend (dev profile) + frontend in background, plus Piper if Docker is available
make stop        # Kill backend + frontend (and Piper)
make clean-db    # Delete the dev database; the next start migrates and seeds a fresh one
make test-fast   # Run integration tests skipping jOOQ codegen
```

See [Makefile targets](#makefile-targets) below for the full reference.

### When to re-run jOOQ codegen

The generated jOOQ sources are committed (`app/src/generated/jooq`). Re-run `./gradlew :app:generateJooq` after changing or adding a migration. Codegen migrates a throwaway SQLite file (`app/build/jooq-codegen/schema.db`) and reads the schema from it, so it needs no Docker.

---

## Manual environment setup

If you prefer to run services individually (e.g. in separate terminal tabs):

### 1. Optional: start Piper

```bash
make up
# or: docker compose up -d
```

This starts **Piper** (text to speech) on `localhost:10200` for announcer voices. Without it the app runs normally with announcements off.

Club logos and TTS clips are stored on local disk under `storage.local-path` (defaults to `./data/uploads`, overridable via `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH`) and served back by the app itself at `/storage/**` — no object-storage server to start.

### 2. Backend

```bash
make dev
# or: ./gradlew :app:bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'
```

On first run, Flyway creates the database file and applies the baseline migrations and the dev seed data:

**Baseline (`db/migration/sqlite/`, V1–V6), grouped by area:**
- `V1` — users and roles, refresh tokens, club profile, governing bodies
- `V2` — tracks, decoder loops, lap thresholds, racing classes, format templates, events and event classes
- `V3` — competitors, entries, entry audit log, RaceHub class mappings
- `V4` — rounds, races, race entries, marshal adjustments/absences/penalties, penalties, incident reports, unknown transponder links
- `V5` — result snapshots and championships
- `V6` — practice sessions and laps

The baseline replaced the PostgreSQL history (V1–V36) in #26; `V1` lists the type conventions. Later migrations: `V7` the results export outbox (#27), `V8` the per-event live feed switch (#28), and `V9` drops the profanity blocklist (#30).

**Dev seeds (`db/seed/sqlite/`, V1000+):**
- `V1001` — tracks, racing classes and race format templates
- `V1002` — admin1 and race director accounts, club profile, "Club Championship Round 1" event (IN_PROGRESS) with 6 competitors and entries (transponders 101–106), 6 rounds (P1/P2/Q1/Q2/Q3/Final A), races and race entries

The dev profile keeps the database in `app/data/db` (relative to `app/`, gitignored). `make clean-db` deletes it.

### 3. Frontend

```bash
make ui
# or: cd frontend && npm run dev
```

Vite dev server starts on `http://localhost:5173` with API proxy to `localhost:8080`.

---

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default (dev) | Description |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | unset: a random key in `jwt-secret` in the data directory | Base64 HMAC-SHA256 key that signs officials' sign-in tokens |
| `RCTIMING_DATA_DIR` | per-user app-data folder (dev profile: `app/data/db`) | Folder holding the SQLite database file `rctiming.db` |
| `STORAGE_LOCAL_PATH` | `uploads` inside the data directory | Folder for the club logo and announcer clips |
| `STORAGE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | `/storage` | Base URL the browser loads uploads from; relative, so it works on any address |
| `SERVER_PORT`, `SERVER_ADDRESS` | `8080`, all interfaces | Port and bind address. Phones and boards reach the app on any of the laptop's addresses. |

Outside the dev profile the database lives in the user's app-data folder: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RCTimingControl` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/RCTimingControl` on macOS, and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rctimingcontrol` (or `~/.local/share/rctimingcontrol`) on Linux. The installed packages run the app as a service with `-Drctiming.data-scope=machine`, which moves it to the per-machine folder instead (see [installing.md](installing.md)).

Without `JWT_SECRET`, the first start writes a random key to `jwt-secret` in the data directory and later starts reuse it, so no two installs share a signing key.

### Serving the frontend from the app

`./gradlew -PbundleFrontend :app:bootJar` builds the frontend into the jar, and `SpaConfig` serves it with REST and WebSocket on the same port. Paths that are not a file and not under `/api`, `/ws`, `/storage` or `/actuator` get `index.html`, so deep links work on refresh. The UI and API share one origin, so no CORS settings are needed, and the WebSocket's same-origin check accepts whichever address a device used. In dev, Vite serves the frontend and proxies `/api`, `/ws` and `/storage` to the backend. `./gradlew -PbundleFrontend :app:installer` wraps the jar in a native installer; see [installing.md](installing.md#building-the-installers).

On start the app logs the addresses other devices should open, and `/about` lists them.

### Backups

The app copies its database into a backup folder when an event is marked completed (the race day closes) and every night, and keeps the newest copies. Admins can see them and take one now under **Admin → Backups**. Backing up is safe while a race is running. The database makes the copy in one read transaction (`VACUUM INTO` on SQLite), and laps keep committing meanwhile.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `RCTIMING_BACKUP_DIRECTORY` (`rctiming.backup.directory`) | `backups` inside the data directory | Where backups go; may be a USB stick or network share |
| `RCTIMING_BACKUP_KEEP` (`rctiming.backup.keep`) | `14` | How many backups to keep; older ones are deleted |
| `RCTIMING_BACKUP_NIGHTLY_CRON` (`rctiming.backup.nightly-cron`) | `0 0 2 * * *` | When the nightly backup runs (server time); `-` turns it off |

To restore, stop the app, then run:

```bash
java -jar app.jar restore /media/usb/rctiming/rctiming-20261004-220000-day-close.db
```

It finds the data directory the way the app does (`RCTIMING_DATA_DIR`, `--rctiming.database.data-directory=...`, or the default folder), checks the backup is sound, and moves the current database aside as `rctiming.db.before-restore-<time>`. Then it puts the backup in its place. It refuses while the app has the database open. When the app next starts, it migrates the restored database if it came from an older version. For the installed app, see [installing.md](installing.md#restoring-a-backup).

### Locked out of the admin account

Admins manage officials under **Admin → Officials**. If no admin can sign in, stop the app and run:

```bash
java -jar app.jar reset-admin-password admin@club.example
```

It finds the data directory the same way, asks for the new password twice, enables the account, gives it `ADMIN` if it had lost it, and signs it out everywhere. With no email it lists the admins. The change is logged as made from the command line. It never creates a database: with none in the data directory it stops. For the installed app, see [installing.md](installing.md#locked-out).

### Running it for real

The app runs on the venue laptop from the installer, which serves the UI, keeps its data in the per-machine folder and starts with the laptop; see [installing.md](installing.md). It is meant for the venue network only and is not deployed to the internet.

- Leave `JWT_SECRET` unset and keep the generated `jwt-secret` file private, or set it to a random 256-bit base64 value.
- Do **not** use `ddl-auto=update` or `create-drop`: Flyway manages the schema.

### Trying it out with the demo club

The `demo` profile loads the Wyvern RC Club (`db/demo/{vendor}`), and `simulate` runs the fake decoder its decoder settings point at:

```bash
./gradlew -PbundleFrontend :app:bootJar
java -jar app/build/libs/app.jar --spring.profiles.active=demo --rctiming.database.data-directory=/tmp/rctiming-demo
java -jar app/build/libs/app.jar simulate   # in a second terminal; no arguments plays the demo transponders
```

Open http://localhost:8080 and sign in as `admin@example.com` / `trial123`. The e2e suite runs against this setup. For an installed copy, see [trial-quickstart.md](trial-quickstart.md).

`decoder-protocol/` holds the pure RC-4 parser, and `decoder-simulator/` the fake decoder and the live feed test relay.

---

## Running tests

```bash
make test-fast                         # app and simulator tests, using the committed jOOQ sources
./gradlew :decoder-protocol:test       # the protocol parser
./gradlew :app:test --tests "dev.monkeypatch.rctiming.timing.*"   # one package
cd frontend && npm test -- --run       # frontend unit tests
```

None of them needs Docker. Each backend test run creates a temporary SQLite database, shared by all integration test classes (one Spring context). `SqliteConcurrencyIT` writes laps while readers poll, and `CrashRecoveryIT` kills the app mid-session and checks no committed lap is lost. The Playwright end-to-end tests run against the demo club and the simulator; see [testing.md](testing.md#end-to-end-tests).

## Developer workflow

### Picking up a piece of work

1. Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/oggthemiffed/RCTimingControl/issues) for the next task
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` for architecture context before starting — it's the primary reference for any AI-assisted session
3. Read `docs/PROJECT.md` for requirements and `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` for the full requirement list

### Making a change

1. Start the dev environment: `make dev-start`
2. Implement the change, following the patterns in `CLAUDE.md` (domain module for writes, jOOQ query module for reads, no cross-module Hibernate)
3. If adding a database column or table, add a Flyway migration (`V{next}__description.sql`) and re-run `./gradlew :app:generateJooq`
4. Write or update tests — backend integration tests in `app/src/test/`, frontend unit tests in `frontend/src/`
5. Run `make test-fast` (backend) and `npm test` in `frontend/` before pushing — add `./gradlew :decoder-protocol:test` if you touched the protocol parser

### Schema changes

Any new `V*__.sql` migration file requires jOOQ codegen to be re-run before the code will compile:

```bash
./gradlew :app:generateJooq
```

Flyway applies migrations automatically on backend startup — you do not need to run them manually.

Migrations live in one folder per database: `app/src/main/resources/db/migration/{vendor}/` (dev seeds in `db/seed/{vendor}/`, the demo club in `db/demo/{vendor}/`, test data in `app/src/test/resources/db/testdata/{vendor}/`). Until the first release on SQLite, the baseline may still be edited in place; after that, every change is a new migration.

### Keeping the database swappable

The database is chosen in one place. `rctiming.database.vendor` picks it, and `DatabaseConfig` (in `persistence/`) applies it to Flyway, Hibernate and jOOQ. The vendor-specific values themselves live in `persistence/vendor/DatabaseVendor`: the JDBC URL, connection settings (for SQLite: WAL, `synchronous=NORMAL`, foreign keys on, a 5 second busy timeout), how many write connections it allows, and the dialects.

The app opens two pools on the database: a write pool (one connection for SQLite, used by JPA, Flyway and Spring transactions) and a read pool of `rctiming.database.read-connections` (default 4) whose connections refuse writes. jOOQ queries outside a transaction go to the read pool; inside a transaction they share the writer.

Column types the databases disagree on are mapped by converters in `persistence/convert/`, not by the schema: timestamps are `Instant` stored as UTC microseconds, date-only values are ISO text, and JSON columns are text read through `JsonTextConverter` subclasses.

Everywhere else the code stays database-neutral:

- Read queries use the jOOQ DSL only: no `DSL.sql(...)`, `field("...")` or other plain-SQL strings.
- Repositories use derived queries or JPQL, never `nativeQuery = true`, and entities carry no `columnDefinition`.
- A vendor-specific statement that can't be avoided goes behind an interface in `persistence/vendor/`, with one implementation per database.

`PersistencePortabilityTest` scans the main sources, and the compiled classes for any jOOQ method marked `@PlainSQL` (so SQL in a variable is caught too), and fails the build if any of this slips in.

Moving to another database means:

1. Add a constant to `DatabaseVendor` with its migrations folder name, jOOQ and Hibernate dialects, JDBC URL, connection settings and write-connection limit.
2. Add baseline migrations under `db/migration/{vendor}/` (and the dev seeds and test data folders).
3. Add the JDBC driver and Flyway database support to `app/build.gradle.kts`.
4. Set `rctiming.database.vendor`, and point the jOOQ codegen in `app/build.gradle.kts` at the new migrations.
5. Run the whole test suite against it.

### Submitting a PR

```bash
gh pr create
```

Reference the GitHub Issue number in the PR description (`Closes #N`). PRs should include passing tests — `make test` runs the full suite, including the decoder simulator tests.

### Working with Claude Code

Open the project in Claude Code from the repo root. `CLAUDE.md` is loaded automatically and gives Claude the full architecture context. For a new feature or bug fix, describe the GitHub Issue and Claude will use the existing patterns.

Key docs to reference in a session:
- `CLAUDE.md` — stack, architecture, module boundaries, rules
- `docs/PROJECT.md` — what the system is and its requirements
- `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — full requirement list: current, planned and removed, with the issue behind each change
- `docs/architecture.md` — deeper architecture notes
- `.planning/phases/` — historical decision log per phase (useful if you hit an unexpected behaviour)
