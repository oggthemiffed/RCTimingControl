# Trying RC Timing Control

> **Early pre-release (v0.1)**: this is a preview build for clubs to evaluate. The features are all there, but the software has not yet been used at a full race meeting. Please report anything that doesn't work.

This guide sets up a copy of the app with a demo club and a simulated decoder, so you can explore race control with live laps. It takes about five minutes and needs no developer tools.

Use a computer you are not using for real race meetings, or uninstall afterwards. The demo club goes into the app's database alongside anything else in it.

---

## What you get

- The full app, pre-loaded with a demo club (Wyvern RC Club), its competitors, entries and transponders, and a completed past event.
- A simulated AMB decoder on the same computer, sending lap passings for the demo transponders so race control shows live timing.
- Every feature to explore: race control, the admin panel, results and championship standings.

---

## Step 1: Install the app

Download the installer for your computer from the [latest release](https://github.com/oggthemiffed/RCTimingControl/releases/latest) and install it as described in [installing.md](installing.md). Don't set the club up yet.

## Step 2: Turn on the demo club

Stop the service, add a setting that loads the demo club, then start the service again. The data folder and the start and stop commands for each system are listed in [installing.md](installing.md).

Create a file called `application.properties` in the data folder containing:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=demo
```

On Linux, for example:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop rctimingcontrol-RCTimingControl
echo 'spring.profiles.active=demo' | sudo tee /var/lib/rctimingcontrol/application.properties
sudo systemctl start rctimingcontrol-RCTimingControl
```

The app loads the demo club when it starts.

## Step 3: Start the simulated decoder

Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and run:

| System | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Windows | `"C:\Program Files\RCTimingControl\RCTimingControl.exe" simulate` |
| macOS | `/Applications/RCTimingControl.app/Contents/MacOS/RCTimingControl simulate` |
| Linux | `/opt/rctimingcontrol/bin/RCTimingControl simulate` |

It sends laps for the demo club's eight transponders on port 5100, where the demo club's decoder settings point. Leave the window open. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

## Step 4: Open the app

Go to **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)** and sign in as `admin@example.com` with the password **`trial123`**. That account is an admin, race director and referee, so it can use everything.

## Things to try

### Run a race with live timing

The demo event, **Wyvern Winter Series Round 4**, is still open for entries, so it has no races yet. These steps take it through a race day.

1. Go to **Admin** → **Events** and open **Wyvern Winter Series Round 4**.
2. Click **Close Entries** and confirm, then click **Start Event**. The event is now In Progress.
3. Go to **Race Control** in the sidebar and choose the event. The bar at the top shows **DECODER connected** while the simulated decoder is running.
4. Click **Generate Rounds**, keep the suggested practice, qualifying and finals settings, and click **Generate Rounds** again. The run order appears on the left with the first race selected.
5. Click **Call Grid**, then **Start Race**. Laps from the simulated decoder appear within about 15 seconds and the running order updates as you watch.
6. When you have seen enough, click **Finish Race** and confirm. The result is saved and shown. Pick the next race in the run order to carry on.

The demo racers aren't checked in, so the grid shows them as not checked in. That doesn't stop the race. Try **Check-in** in the top bar to check some in.

While a race is running, open these in other tabs or on a phone (see the About page for the address to use):

- [/boards/now-next](http://localhost:8080/boards/now-next): the spectator board with the race on track and what's next.
- [/boards/overlay](http://localhost:8080/boards/overlay): the streaming overlay for OBS.

### Admin

1. Go to **Admin** → **Championships** to see the points standings from the demo's past round.
2. Go to **Admin** → **Club Profile** to see the club's details. You can edit them to match your own club.
3. Go to **Admin** → **Decoder** to see how the decoder connection is set up.

### Open practice

When no race is running, go to **Race Control**, choose the event, then **Practice** in the top bar. Click **New Session**, give it a name, then **Start Practice** to see laps for every demo racer without a race.

### Public pages

Open [http://localhost:8080/events](http://localhost:8080/events) in a second tab. This is the public event schedule, which needs no sign-in. Phones on the same network can open it too, using the addresses listed on the About page.

---

## Finishing

To stop trying it, stop the simulated decoder with `Ctrl+C`. Then uninstall the app and delete its data folder, as described in [installing.md](installing.md). If you want to use the same computer for real race meetings, install again afterwards and set up your own club.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing opens at http://localhost:8080.** The service takes a few seconds to start. If something else on the computer already uses port 8080, add `server.port=8081` (or another free port) to `application.properties`, restart the service and use that port.

**No demo club.** The setting has to be in place before the service starts. Check the file is called `application.properties` (not `application.properties.txt`) and is in the data folder, then restart the service. The app's log, `logs/rctiming.log` in the data folder, lists `wyvern demo club` among the database steps when it loads the demo club.

**No live laps.** Laps only show while a race or a practice session is running. Check the simulated decoder window is still open and shows `Client connected`. The decoder status in race control shows whether the app is connected to it.

**Race control says no events are in progress.** Close the event's entries and start it first, as in step 2 above.
