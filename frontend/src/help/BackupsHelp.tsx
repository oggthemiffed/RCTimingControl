        The Backups page lists the copies of the club&apos;s database that RCTC keeps. It takes
        one when you close a race day and every night, and keeps the newest copies. Backing up is
        safe while racing carries on.

        <li><span className="font-semibold">Why each copy was taken:</span> Each row says whether it was taken by hand, nightly, or when the race day was closed, and how big it is.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Backup folder:</span> The page shows where the copies are kept. Copy that folder to a USB stick now and then so a lost or broken laptop doesn&apos;t take the club&apos;s results with it.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Restoring:</span> This is done on the timing laptop with the service stopped, not from this page. The command for each system is in the installation guide, under &quot;Restoring a backup&quot;.</li>

          If &quot;Back up now&quot; fails, check the backup folder exists and has room. A backup
          folder on a USB stick only works while the stick is plugged in. Restoring puts the old
          data back, so anything entered since that copy was taken is lost; the database it
          replaces is kept beside it, not deleted.
