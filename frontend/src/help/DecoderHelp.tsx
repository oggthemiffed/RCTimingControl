        The Decoder page tells RCTC where the AMB decoder is on the venue network. RCTC connects to
        it directly, and reconnects on its own if the link drops. Race control shows whether the
        decoder is connected in its status bar.

          Never connect RCTC and another timing program (such as RCResults) to the same decoder at
          the same time; one of them may quietly stop receiving laps. Close the other program
          first. The decoder guide has more on hardware and the simulator.
