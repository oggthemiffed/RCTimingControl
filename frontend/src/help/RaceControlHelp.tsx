        The Cockpit is the central race control interface for running a meeting. It shows
        the full run order for the event in the left sidebar, and the main panel updates
        based on the selected race's state — from calling the grid through to live timing
        and final results.

      <ul className="mt-3 space-y-1.5 text-sm">
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Generate rounds:</span> A new event has no races. Click "Generate Rounds" to build its practice, qualifying and finals run order.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Select a race:</span> Click any race in the Run Order sidebar to make it the active race.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Call Grid:</span> When the race is in Pending state, click "Call Grid" to move it to Grid state and open the grid editor.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Start / Stop:</span> Use the "Start" button from the Grid editor to begin timing, and the "Stop" button during a running race to pause it.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Link unknown transponder:</span> If a transponder is detected but not linked to an entry, a badge appears with a "Link to entry" button — resolve it during the race.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Jump to race:</span> Select a pending race while another is active and click "Jump to this race" to skip ahead in the run order.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Corrections after the finish:</span> A finished race&apos;s result is rebuilt when a penalty or lap correction is recorded for it, so results pages, championship points and the download all show the corrected order. For an event imported from RaceHub, a corrected result is queued to be sent again.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Boards for screens:</span> Spectators need no login. Open /boards/now-next (the race on track and what is next) or /boards/results (the last finished race) on a TV, or /boards/overlay as a Browser source in OBS. The Race Meeting Guide lists the options.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Live feed:</span> When the club has a live feed relay set up, the status bar shows LIVE FEED next to the decoder. Turn on "Send this event" so people away from the track can follow each race; racing carries on as normal if the feed drops out.</li>

          The Start button only appears once the race is in Grid state — you must click
          "Call Grid" first. When the race is over, click "Finish Race" to save its result.
          If a race shows Stopped, use "Resume Race" to continue, "Finish Race" to end it
          there, or "Abandon" to discard it. Bump-up promotions are shown as a toast notification
          after a Final finishes — always check the grid before starting the next final.
