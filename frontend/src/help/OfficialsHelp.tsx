        <li><span className="font-semibold">Forgotten password:</span> Click Password on their row, set a new one and tell them it in person. RCTC sends no email. Their other sessions end when it is set.</li>

          The last admin who can sign in can&apos;t be disabled or lose the admin role, and you can&apos;t
          disable yourself. If the only admin forgets their password, run
          <code className="mx-1">RCTimingControl reset-admin-password</code>
          on the timing laptop, as described in the installation guide.
