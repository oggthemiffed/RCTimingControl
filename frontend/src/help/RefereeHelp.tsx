        The Referee View shows the live timing table for one race, with controls for raising incident
        reports and applying penalties. It opens on the race in progress. Rows that tint are cars
        closing quickly on the car ahead.

      <ul className="mt-3 space-y-1.5 text-sm">
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Select a race:</span> Click any race in the Run Order sidebar and the table shows that race.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Raise Incident:</span> Click &quot;Raise Incident&quot;, choose the Driver, the Type (Jump start, Collision, Shortcut, Dangerous driving or Other) and a short Description. The report is logged with who raised it and when.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Apply Penalty:</span> Click &quot;Apply Penalty&quot;, choose the Driver, then &quot;Lap deduction&quot; (whole laps) or &quot;Time penalty (s)&quot; (seconds), the amount and a Reason. A lap deduction takes the laps off the live count straight away. A time penalty is added to the driver&apos;s total time in the result when the race finishes.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Proximity alerts:</span> A tinted row means that car has closed on the one ahead by more than half a second since the last update and is within three seconds of it. Use it to spot contact in the making.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Unknown transponders:</span> A number that matches no entry in the running race, or matches more than one entry, is not credited to anyone. It appears as an &quot;Unknown Transponders&quot; alert in the race director&apos;s Cockpit with a &quot;Link to entry&quot; button; a race director or admin picks the right entry and its laps are credited back to the start. The Referee View does not show that alert.</li>

          The Raise Incident and Apply Penalty buttons are disabled until a race is selected, and the
          Driver list is built from live timing, so it holds only cars that have been timed in that
          race and is empty once the race has finished. Give a penalty before the race is
          finished where you can. Penalties cannot be undone from this page, so check the driver,
          type and amount before you submit. These tools need the Referee role (or admin).
