        The Practice Sessions page lists recent open-practice sessions, across all events. A session shows its event name only when it is linked to one. Practice timing
        runs on its own, apart from the event&apos;s run order, and does not count towards
        championship points. Each session shows its status (Idle, Running or Stopped) and how many
        consecutive laps its &quot;best laps&quot; figure uses.

        <li><span className="font-semibold">New Session:</span> Click &quot;New Session&quot;, give the session a name, and choose &quot;Best consecutive laps (N)&quot;, from 1 to 20 (3 is suggested). The session belongs to the event whose Race Control you opened Practice from.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Open a session:</span> Click a session in the list. An Idle session shows &quot;Start Practice&quot;; a Running one shows &quot;Stop Practice&quot;.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Names on the table:</span> Each transponder is matched to the competitor who has it on an entry in the event (primary or secondary number) and shown under Racer by name. A number no entry uses is shown as its number with an Unknown tag, and an alert lists unknown numbers above the table.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Reading the table:</span> Pos, Laps, Best Lap, &quot;Best N Laps&quot; (the best average over N consecutive laps) and Last Lap. Cars are ranked by most laps, then by fastest best lap. A car&apos;s first crossing only starts its first lap.</li>
        <li><span className="font-semibold">Print Results:</span> Once a session is Stopped, click &quot;Print Results&quot; to open a printable sheet with the same columns, and use the Print button on it. &quot;New Session&quot; is offered there too.</li>

        <p>
          Practice is not tied to a race entry, so any transponder the decoder hears while a session
          is running is recorded, including cars not entered in the event, and shown as Unknown.
          Make sure only drivers meant for the session are on track. A session made with &quot;New
          Session&quot; from a stopped session&apos;s own page has no event, so its drivers show as
          numbers; start it from the event&apos;s Practice page to get names. Practice sessions
          are run by race directors and admins.
